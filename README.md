### 1. Point Transformation
- **Point Transformation**: Image processing technique where only the pixel values are changed (the pixel position remains unchanged). This method handles only the pixel's value itself.
- **Mapping**: Two types - forward mapping and inverse mapping.

### 2. Geometric Transformation
- **Geometric Transformation**: An image processing technique where the pixel positions are changed, not the pixel values.
- **Interpolation**: Used to estimate pixel values during geometric transformations.

### 3. Spatial-Domain Filtering
- **Spatial-Domain Filtering**: A technique that changes both the pixel values and their positions using the values of neighboring pixels.

### 4. Frequency-Domain Processing
- **Frequency-Domain Processing**: Image processing performed in the frequency domain, often allowing for more efficient manipulation of certain image properties.

### 5. Compression
- **Image Compression Techniques**: Methods used to reduce image data size to optimize storage and transmission, particularly useful in high-traffic environments.
  - **Encoder**: Processes to reduce the image data size.
  - **Decoder**: Reconstructs the compressed image data back to its original form.
